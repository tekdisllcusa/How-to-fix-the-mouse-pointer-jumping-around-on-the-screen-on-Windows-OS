How to fix the mouse pointer jumping around on the screen 
Due to a Windows bug that has not been fixed, the serial stream from a GPS can be misinterpreted 
as a mouse input. 
Microsoft have a few suggestions onto how to resolve, however most do not work. 
The proven way to fix the problem is to disable the Serial Ball Point mouse within the Device 
Manager. 
Procedure 
To disable the Serial Ballpoint Mouse; 
NOTE: As you are navigating the menus, the errant mouse pointer is going to continue moving 
around the screen and send phantom clicks. It is suggested to ALT+TAB back to the Device Manager 
and use the keyboard arrows to select the Microsoft Serial Ballpoint mouse. 
1. Right click on the Windows Start Icon, and select “Device Manager” 
2. Navigate down to “Mice and other pointing devices” and expand the menu. 
3. Right click on the Microsoft Serial Ballpoint Mouse and select “Disable Device” 
4. The mouse pointer should remain stationary until the actual physical mouse is moved. 
If the GPS is not required, you can enter the BIOS and disable Serial Port 4.
